# Biometric Login

A basic flutter example on biometric login

## Project Setup
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/biometriclogin.git
   cd biometriclogin
   ```
```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Key Features
- Biometric Authentication : Users can log in using their device's biometric capabilities
- Fallback Options : If biometric authentication fails, users can log in using a PIN or password.

## Limitations and Assumptions
- Device Compatibility: The app requires a device that supports biometric authentication. It may not function correctly on devices without biometric capabilities.
- Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented, but further enhancements may be needed for production-level applications.
